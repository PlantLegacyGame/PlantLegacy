# Task records

One file per task, written when the task is completed. A task record is the
evidence that the acceptance criteria in `DESIGN.md` were met — not a second
design document.

## Rules

1. **One task per session.** Do not start the next task in the same session
   (DESIGN.md, Session Protocol). T00 + O01 are the one sanctioned pair because
   O01 depends on T00 and both are Phase 0 foundation.
2. Mark the task `[x]` here and in its record only when the acceptance criteria
   are met. External criteria that need a remote (CI run, live staging URL) stay
   `[ ]` with a note until they are actually observed.
3. Every record contains: implementation summary, config files touched, a
   tunables table (type/range/default/effect), the manual test checklist result,
   and `CONTEXT.md` / `ATTRIBUTION.md` updates.
4. No hardcoded values (RULE_3). No `rarity` field (RULE_20). Account-bound flag
   invariant enforced (RULE_23).
5. Update `docs/what-works-now.md` at every gate.

## Status

| Task | Name | Status | Record |
|---|---|---|---|
| T00 | Foundation | `[x]` | [T00.md](./T00.md) |
| O01 | Repo and deploy pipeline | `[x]` (local; deploy verification pending remote) | [O01.md](./O01.md) |
| T03P | Networking gate (Gate 0) | next | — |

## Naming

`docs/tasks/<TASK_ID>.md` — for example `T03P.md`, `C01.md`, `O02.md`.
Manual checklists live in `docs/checklists/<TASK_ID>-manual.md`.
